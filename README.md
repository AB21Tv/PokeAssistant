# PokéAssistant

A Pokétwo Hack/Assistant Bot that identifies Pokémons from Pokétwo spawns, pings a role if a legendary spawns, pings you if your Shiny Hunt Pokémon spawns and more! This is not against Discord TOS.

#### Creating the bot account
After creating the application, we need to create the Bot User. Go to the `Bot` section on the left, then click on **Add Bot**, then **Yes, Do it**.

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/660518707134595095/830720692583923723/3.png)

There's a few things you can change here. 
- Username: Change your bot's username on Discord
- Icon: Change the bot's avatar
- Public bot: Toggles the ability for other users to add your bot to their server.
- Require Oauth2 Code Grant: Don't check this. Just, don't.

After doing these, scroll down,

Copy the link and open it, select your server and click on **Authorize**. Cheers, it has been added to your server.
#### Getting the token
Go to the **Bot** page and copy the token. Save it somewhere, you will need that later.

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/660518707134595095/830720955277508628/5.png)


### Step 2: Hosting the bot
The bot will be hosted on Replit, so you need to create a Replit account first: https://replit.com/login.
#### Getting the code
The code has already been setup, you only need to go to https://replit.com/@ButterTaurus/PokeAssistant and click `fork`. Wait 10-60 seconds after forking.

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/678537293820330005/830756922487603220/6.png)

#### Configuration

**PC Users**: Click on `Secrets (Environment Variables)`, it's a Lock Icon

**Mobile Users**: Click Commands Tab, click dropdown menu if the body is blank; Click `Secrets (Environment Variables)`

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/696949237786738712/836619338051878923/12.jpg)

#### First Secret
- Click `Secrets (Environment Variables)`
- Type `TOKEN` in Key Section
- Paste Bot Token in Value Section
- Click `Add new Secret`

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/696949237786738712/836619330636480553/13.jpg)

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/696949237786738712/836619328748257310/14.jpg)

(Mobile users will click green **play** button to run)
(PC users will click Green **Run** Button.)

The bot should be online now!

### Step 3: Keeping the bot online (Optional)
Replit shuts down projects that are inactive for over 5 minutes. The current code should already keep it up, but some users feedback that it doesn't. We will be using Uptime Robot to keep it up here. Create an account first: https://uptimerobot.com/signUp.

After signing up, login and go to the Dashboard, click on **Create New Monitor**, the configurations are as follows:

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/678537293820330005/830758495824510986/8.png)

- Monitor Type: Choose HTTP(s)
- Friendly Name: Literally anything
- URL (or IP): Put `your repl`'s link. Repl links are [these](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/678537293820330005/830757823549276160/7.png) and mobile users will click `web` button to get the repl link.
- Monitoring Interval: 5 minutes

Finally click **Create Monitor** and you're done! Done with everything!

### Keep in Mind
- If the bot gets updated, you will need to copy the index.js code and paste it in the index.js of your repl or the bot will stop working
- The bot will identify 1 Pokémon every 40 seconds; if there are multiple spawns in 40 seconds, the bot will get rate limited
- Reduce the number of channels in `.env` if the bot gets rate limited too many times
- The bot must have permissions to send embeds
- Make sure `.env` is not empty and information provided there is correct
- Make sure the bot can DM the owner
- The bot's accuracy is 80%
- Do not show the bot token to others
- Do not edit the code, because it will break the whole bot :/

## Questions
### Why is the source code messed up?
It's encrypted/obfuscated. I don't want Pokétwo mods to read and patch against it and also don't want other coders to make an auto-catcher with the help of PokeAssistant.  But you can run it without problem!
### Why can't I invite the bot instead of hosting it?
Discord does not verify bots that work against other bots. Server limit for unverified bots is 100 and bots in 1K+ servers need too much ram. That means you can't invite it to your server, if it's in 100 servers already 😵. With the help of this guide, you can make your own bot and customize it without coding!
### Want to help?
Star the repository, refer your friends to this Github repository! Join the support server to request faster results, no ads and decreased rate limit! You must create a support ticket to contact the moderators.
### Is it harmful?
The bot is not against Discord TOS. But do not show your bot token to others.
### How do I update the code?
Updating is optional. If the bot asks you to update, that means it is compulsory and not optional.
For updating, copy this [code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TrashUwU/PokeAssistant/main/src/index.js). Go to https://replit.com/repls and click your PokéAssistant REPL. After the editor has loaded, select all codes and press backspace to clear everything from the file. Now paste the copied code. Now delete `json.sqlite`(**Mobile**: Click `files` button and click `•••` beside `json.sqlite`), now press Run/Play Button. Make sure Run/Play button now looks like a square. (Not a triangle)
