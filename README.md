# Pok√©Assistant
A Pok√©two Hack/Assistant Bot to help you with catching Pok√©mons on Pok√©two.
## Information
Pok√©Assistant is a bot aimed to help Pok√©two players. It will tell you what Pok√©mon it is whenever Pok√©two spawns one (Free) and will also ping a role if rare pokemons spawn (Premium Only). As such, you no longer have to rack your brains or even search Google. Sometimes, you may just miss a rare Pok√©mon like this.

### Step 0.5: Create a Github Account
Visit https://github.com/join and create a Github Account.

### Step 0.9: Star the repository
Visit https://github.com/TrashUwU/PokeAssistant/stargazers and click the star button!

### Step 1: Creating a bot account
The first step in creating a bot is to create your own Discord application. The bot will use the Discord API, which requires the creation of an account for authentication purposes. Don't worry though, it's super simple.
#### Creating the application
To create the application, head to https://discord.com/developers/applications/. Log in, and you'll reach a page that may look like this:

![](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/660518707134595095/830720086921707540/1.png)

Click on **Create an application**. This brings you to the following page, in which you should simply enter a name for the application. After clicking **Create**, you can also add an avatar. Click **Save Changes** afterwards.

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/660518707134595095/830720419568418857/2.png)

#### Creating the bot account
After creating the application, we need to create the Bot User. Go to the Bot section on the left, then click on **Add Bot**, then **Yes, Do it**.

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/660518707134595095/830720692583923723/3.png)

There's a few things you can change here. 
- Username: Change your bot's username on Discord
- Icon: Change the bot's avatar
- Public bot: Toggles the ability for other users to add your bot to their server.
- Require Oauth2 Code Grant: Don't check this. Just, don't.
#### Adding to your server
To generate the invite link, click on **Oauth2** in the app page, and scroll down to **Scopes**. Check the **Bot** scope to generate a link. You can also add additional permissions for the bot.

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/660518707134595095/830720814994161664/4.png)

Copy the link and open it, select your server and click on **Authorize**. Cheers, it has been added to your server.
#### Getting the token
Go to the **Bot** page and copy the token. Save it somewhere, you will need that later.

### Step 2: Hosting the bot
The bot will be hosted on Replit, so you need to create a Replit account first: https://replit.com/login.
#### Getting the code
The code has already been setup, you only need to go to https://replit.com/@ButterTaurus/PokeAssistant and click `fork`. Wait 10-60 seconds after forking.

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/678537293820330005/830756922487603220/6.png)

#### Configuration
(Mobile users will click `files` button to see all files, all files will be visible to PC users by default)
Click on `Secrets (Environment Variables)`

(**Mobile Users**: Click Commands Tab, click dropdown menu if the body is blank; Click Secrets `(Environment Variables)` and type `TOKEN` in Key section and paste the bot token in Value section and Add Secret. Do the same with Values `CHANNEL` and `OWNER`, paste the Channel IDs of Pokemon spawning channels(Separate with `,` if there are many) and paste owner account ID.)

![](https://i.postimg.cc/DZXmC2Jg/8.png)

Type `TOKEN` in the Key section and paste the bot token in the Value section. Then click `Add new Secret`. (Shown Above)

Just like TOKEN Key and Value, type `CHANNEL` in the Key section and paste the Channel IDs(Separate with `,` without spaces if multiple channels) in the Value section. Then click `Add new Secret`.

Same as above, type `OWNER` in the Key section and paste your account ID in the Value section. Then click `Add new Secret`.



![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/806194434117992499/831071426491449355/10.png)
(Mobile users will click on console and click green **play** button to run)
(PC users will click Green **Run** Button.)

The bot should be online now!

### Step 3: Keeping the bot online (Optional)
Replit shuts down projects that are inactive for over 5 minutes. The current code should already keep it up, but some users feedback that it doesn't. We will be using Uptime Robot to keep it up here. Create an account first: https://uptimerobot.com/signUp.

After signing up, login and go to the Dashboard, click on **Create New Monitor**, the configurations are as follows:

![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/678537293820330005/830758495824510986/8.png)

- Monitor Type: Choose HTTP(s)
- Friendly Name: Literally anything
- URL (or IP): Put `your repl`'s link. Repl links are [these](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/678537293820330005/830757823549276160/7.png) and mobile users will click `web` button to get the repl link.
- Monitoring Interval: 5 minutes

Finally click **Create Monitor** and you're done! Done with everything!

### Keep in Mind
- If the bot gets updated, you will need to copy the index.js code and paste it in the index.js of your repl or the bot will stop working
- The bot will identify 1 pokemon every 40 seconds; if there are multiple spawns in 40 seconds, the bot will get rate limited
- Reduce the number of channels in `.env` if the bot gets rate limited too many times
- The bot must have permissions to send embeds
- Upgraded/Premium bot includes decreased rate limits(1 pokemon every 15 seconds), no ads, pings a role if a rare pokemon has spawned, gives final prediction and faster response
- Make sure `.env` is not empty and information provided there is correct
- Make sure the bot can DM the owner
- The bot's accuracy is 80%
- Do not show the bot token to others
- Do not edit the code, because it will break the whole bot :/

## Questions

### Why is the source code messed up?
It's encrypted/obfuscated. I don't want Pok√©two mods to read and patch against it. But you can run it without problem!
### Why can't I invite the bot instead of hosting it?
Discord does not verify bots that work against other bots. Server limit for unverified bots is 100 and bots in 1K+ servers need too much ram. That means you can't invite it to your server, if it's in 100 servers already üòµ. With the help of this guide, you can make your own bot and customize it without coding!
### Want to help?
Star the repository, refer your friends to this Github repository! Join the support server to request faster results, no ads and decreased rate limit! You must create a support ticket to contact the moderators.
### Is it harmful?
The bot is completely safe. You will not get banned from Pok√©two or Discord. But do not show your bot token to others.
### How do I update the code?
Updating is optional. If the bot asks you to update, that means it is compulsory not optional.
For updating, copy the code of [index.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TrashUwU/PokeAssistant/main/src/index.js) and remove everything from the index.js of your REPL. Now paste the code.
